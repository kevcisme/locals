# locals

## Welcome to locals, a project I'm working on to facilitate communication.

### This was based on Area 3 from the i-Team's page: http://losangelesinnovates.com/projects

#### Area 3 is defined as Helping Increase Social Cohesion and Inclusivity in Neighborhoods

This project would bring social cohesion by creating space for dialogue. 

Townhall is a great place for discussions like:
* What's happening in your community.
* What are the things that you'd like the community to get involved with.
* Getting to know your neighbors.
